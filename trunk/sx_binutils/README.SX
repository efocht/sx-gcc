This directory contains only an excerpt of binutils, the directories which
are interesting to see for an SX port.

Once the SX specific files are done they will need to be embedded into a
full checkout of binutils.

The current (July 5, 2007) checkout is the CVS version of binutils, this contains
the latest inspiring CPU aupport, eg. spu.
