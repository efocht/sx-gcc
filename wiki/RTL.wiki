#summary Register Transfer Language

Internally the GNU compiler uses the RTL to represent the operations that it created while parsing the language to be compiled.
There are basically two representations for this language. One is a lisp-like language and the other one is a representation through C structures and pointers that comprise the language tree. The lisp-like language is a helpful tool to describe these C structures more easily and especially the operations that can be done with them.
