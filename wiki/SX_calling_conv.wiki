#summary SuperUX calling conventions and return values

= Calling conventions =

This will describe the calling convention for C programs. Fortran or other languages might differ from this scheme.

The location of the arguments passed to a function is stored in $s34. The callee stores a copy of this entry in $s3, too.

Judging from compiler output, it seems that the callee first saves registers starting from $s1 into the area pointed to by $s2 - 272:
{{{
stm $s1,8,-272(,$s2)
}}}
Then that address is stored in $s1 as the bottom of the current stack frame.
