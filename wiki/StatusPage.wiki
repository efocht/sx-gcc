#summary Status of the port.

= Status =

There already exists a framework within the regular GCC 4.2.2 tree that allows to compile an SX cross compiler on i386 / x86_64 architectures (others have not been tested!).

We do regular tests and the current results can be found at :

= Checking out and building the source =

Instructions are on the [BuildTest Building and Testing] wiki page.

= Testing =

Do a
{{{
cd ../test
env PATH=$PATH:$BUILDDIR/gcc gcc-cross -S -dP test.c
}}}
... and look at the produced assembler file _test.s_.

The command line options related to dumping RTL at any of the compiler passes are interesting. *-dP* dumps RTL code as comment into the assembler output. But many more options can be used, check out the gcc manpage and options starting with *-fdump-rtl-*. For dumping all RTL intermediate files try *-fdump-rtl-all*.
