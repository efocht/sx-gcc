#summary Status of the port.

= Status =

There already exists a framework within the regular GCC 4.2.2 tree that allows to compile an SX cross compiler on i386 / x86_64 architectures (others have not been tested!).

We do regular tests and the current results can be found at :

Currently the largest number of the tests that fail are in the "libstdc++" group. They can roughly be categorized in 4 groups:
 # 16 test cases fail because of the issue #138 in the sx-gcc bugtracker. We could fix them if we started using the SX format for quad precision floating point numbers instead of IEEE format.
 # 4 test cases fail because of the issue #141 in the sx-gcc bugtracker. These test cases fail only if the "-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections" switches are used when compiling the code.
 # 39 test cases fail because of the issue #139 in the sx-gcc bugtracker. These test cases fail to compile only if the "-g" switch is used when compiling the code (i.e. debugging info is enabled).
 # the cause of failure for the rest of the test cases is unknown. Some more time would have to be spent to identify them.
